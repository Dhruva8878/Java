Abstract Class :-

The abstract classes are also known as partially implemented method because some of
methods doesn't have their bodies. To define a abstract class we have to use a keyword
(Abstract)  and if any normal class want to extend the abstract class it has to
overright the unimplemented methods of abstract class.


Interface Class:-

Basically Interface can also known as fully unimplemented method but with the help new (1.8 version)
we can also include some of the implement methods in our interface. to extend a interface we use a
keyword known as implements. and also we have overight the method of the interface class.
