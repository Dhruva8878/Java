In Java, strings are immutable. This means, once we create a string, we cannot
change that string.

Strings are immutable if we compare two Immutable with same value they give us true because it overrides
the value the we declare previous but when we use StringBuilder they create new space for every String that
we declare if it is same but it  always create new space for every element.


1. int length(): Returns the number of characters in the String
2. Char charAt(int i): Returns the character at ith index.
3. String concat( String str): Concatenates specified string to the end of this string
4. int indexOf (String s, int i): Returns the index within the string of the first
occurrence of the specified string, starting at the specified index.
5. String toUpperCase(): Converts all the characters in the String to upper case.
