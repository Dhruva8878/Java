Super-:  The super keyword in Java is a reference variable that is used to refer to immediate
         parent class object.
         Whenever you create the instance of a subclass, an instance of parent class is created
         implicitly which is referred by the super reference variable.


this:- The this keyword can be used to refer current class instance variable. If there is
       ambiguity between the instance variables and parameters, this keyword resolves the
        problem of ambiguity.
        
Multiple Inheritance:-To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not
                      supported in java.
