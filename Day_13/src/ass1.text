Dynamic binding is not a type of polymorphism; rather dynamic binding is
how polymorphism is implemented or how it works. And dynamic binding and
runtime binding are the same thing. Dynamic Binding is the more academic
or computer science based name for it. And "run time binding" is a more
every day term for it.
